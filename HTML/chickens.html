            The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species
            that arose from the red jungle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowl">fowl</a>, originally from India.
            They have also partially hybridized with other wild species
            of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon junglefowl,
            and green junglefowl).<sup><a href="somesource.com">[1]</a></sup> Rooster and cock are terms
            for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called
            a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon.
            An adult female bird is called a hen, and a sexually
            immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens
            primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs)
            or as pets. Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting,
            which is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated
            for meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.
        </p>

        <p>
            Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals,
            with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[2] up from more
            than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than
            any other bird. There are numerous cultural references to chickensâ€”in
            myth, folklore, and religion, as well as in language and literature.

            <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <p>
                Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).
                [20] In fact, chicken was originally a term only for an immature, or at
                least young, bird.[when?] In older sources, and still often in trade and
                scientific contexts, chicken as a species are typically referred to as common
                fowl or domestic fowl.[21]

        <h2>Biology and habitat</h2>
        <p>
            Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long,
            flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks (hackles) and backs (saddle),
            which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those of females of the same breed.
            However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed
            neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. Identification can be made by looking at the comb,
            or eventually by the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain
            hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour).

        <h3>Behavior</h3>

        <h4>Social behaviour</h4>
        <p>
            Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the
            incubation of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others,
            establishing a pecking order, with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting
            locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order
            until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock
            can lead to fighting and injury
        </p>

        <h4>Broodiness</h4>
        <p>
            Under natural conditions, most birds lay only until a clutch is complete and they will then incubate all
            the eggs. Hens are then said to "go broody". The broody hen will stop laying and instead will focus on the
            incubation of the eggs (a full clutch is usually about 12 eggs). She will sit or 'set' on the nest, fluffing
            up or pecking in defense if disturbed or removed. The hen will rarely leave the nest to eat, drink, or
            dust-bathe.[35]
            While brooding, the hen maintains the nest at a constant temperature and humidity, as well as turning the eggs
            regularly
            during the first part of the incubation. To stimulate broodiness, owners may place several artificial eggs in
            the nest.
            To discourage it, they may place the hen in an elevated cage with an open wire floor.
