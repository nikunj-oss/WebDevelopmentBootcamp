Chicken

<p>
The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species 
that arose from the red junglefowl, originally from India. 
They have also partially hybridized with other wild species 
of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon junglefowl, 
and green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock are terms 
for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called 
a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. 
An adult female bird is called a hen, and a sexually 
immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens 
primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) 
or as pets. Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting, 
which is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated 
for meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.

Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, 
with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[2] up from more 
than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than 
any other bird. There are numerous cultural references to chickensâ€”in 
myth, folklore, and religion, as well as in language and literature.
